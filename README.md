# [Project 1:  Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection Project](https://github.com/chikeokwudiafor/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project for my Artificial Intelligence class at Duquesne University by Chike Okwudiafor, Eric Ato Brown, and Obehi Irekponor
* This project is aimed at using the available machine learning algorithms and techniques to aid financial institutions and clients detect fraudulent credit card transactions. 
* We hope that, we will be able to establish insights to help both parties to identify fraudulent transactions thereby saving them from loss of money.
* The machine learning algorithms we used are Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and K-Means Clustering in predicting genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions.
* In all, we seek to understand how the various chosen algorithms will be meaningful in establishing weather there is a higher magnitude of credit card fraud or no fraud.
*  We will use the selected Machine learning Algorithms to analyze and predict large data looking for patterns and anomaly.



# [Project 2 : AirFrance-Internet-Marketing-Optimization](https://github.com/chikeokwudiafor/AirFrance-Internet-Marketing-Optimization-)
# Overview
* This is a project done in my Behavioral Analytics Class with a team of two.
* Behavioral Analytics: Air France Internet Marketing campaign effectiveness using Python to analyze the factors that affect total Cost. We analyzed different metrics that could affect the campaign effectiveness. 
* These were some of our observation, a detailed report can be found in the pdf on the github project.
