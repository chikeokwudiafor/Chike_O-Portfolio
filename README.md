# Project 1:  Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection Project 
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project for my Artificial Intelligence class at Duquesne University by Chike Okwudiafor, Eric Ato Brown, and Obehi Irekponor

## INTRODUCTION
Credit card fraud happens when a non- owner of a card uses a third partiesâ€™ card to transact business without
the knowledge of the person. In many cases, a fraudster can obtain your financial information and use it to
make fraudulent purchases. In view of some of the ways through which credit card fraud occurs, this project is aimed at using the
available machine learning algorithms and techniques to aid financial institutions and clients detect fraudulent
credit card transactions. We hope that, we will be able to establish insights to help both parties to identify
fraudulent transactions thereby saving them from loss of money.

The machine learning algorithms we used are Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Random
Forest and K-Means Clustering in predicting genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions. In all, we seek
to understand how the various chosen algorithms will be meaningful in establishing weather there is a
higher magnitude of credit card fraud or no fraud. We will use the selected Machine learning Algorithms
to analyze and predict large data looking for patterns and anomaly.
